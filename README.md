# Sep Alamouti Portfolio Website 🚀

## Description 📝

This project involved creating a personal portfolio website to showcase my work and provide an easy way to contact me. The website is designed with mobile responsiveness and accessibility in mind, ensuring that all visitors can navigate through it easily.

## Features 🌟

### HTML:

📚 Semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, aside, footer) are used for a clear structure, improved readability, and better accessibility.

🖼️ All images are accompanied by meaningful alt attributes to improve accessibility for visually impaired users or in cases where the image fails to load.

📑 The webpage title is relevant and descriptive of the site's content.

### CSS:

🎨 The CSS for this project enhances the site's aesthetic appeal and accessibility. Semantic elements in the HTML and efficient CSS techniques ensure a pleasing user experience.

#### Detailed CSS Changes 📝

**CSS Variables:** CSS variables are used to maintain consistency and make future changes easier. These variables, defined in the :root selector, include color schemes and font families used throughout the website.

**CSS Selectors:** Various types of CSS selectors are used for efficient styling. This includes element selectors (e.g., body, p, h1), class selectors (e.g., .header, .footer), the universal selector (\*), and pseudo-class selectors (e.g., :root).

**Box Model:** The box-sizing property is set to border-box for all elements. This includes the padding and border in an element's total width and height, providing a more predictable layout.

**Cascade Order:** The cascade order in CSS is respected to ensure the styles are applied as intended. Specificity and source order have been taken into account, with more specific selectors overriding more general ones.

### Accessibility Standards 🎯

The website is built in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as set out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
